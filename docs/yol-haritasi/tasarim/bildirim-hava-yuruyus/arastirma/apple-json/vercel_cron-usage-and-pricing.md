# Usage & Pricing for Cron Jobs

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Cron Jobs

Cron jobs invoke [Vercel Functions](/docs/functions). This means the same [usage](/docs/limits) and [pricing](/pricing) limits will apply.

|                | **Number of cron jobs per project** | **Minimum interval** | **Scheduling precision** |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Hobby**      | 100 cron jobs                       | Once per day         | Per-hour (±59 min)       |
| **Pro**        | 100 cron jobs                       | Once per minute      | Per-minute               |
| **Enterprise** | 100 cron jobs                       | Once per minute      | Per-minute               |

### Hobby scheduling limits

> **💡 Note:** Hobby accounts are limited to cron jobs that run **once per day**. Cron
> expressions that would run more frequently will fail during deployment.

Hobby plans have two restrictions on cron jobs:

1. **Daily execution limit**: Cron jobs can only run once per day. Expressions like `0 * * * *` (per-hour) or `*/30 * * * *` (every 30 minutes) will fail deployment with the error:
   *Hobby accounts are limited to daily cron jobs. This cron expression would run more than once per day.*

2. **Timing precision**: Vercel cannot assure a timely cron job invocation. For example, a cron job configured as `0 1 * * *` (every day at 1 am) will trigger anywhere between 1:00 am and 1:59 am.

For cron jobs that run more frequently or with precise timing, **upgrade to our [Pro](/docs/plans/pro-plan) plan**.

## Pricing

Cron jobs are included in **all plans**.

You use a function to invoke a cron job, and therefore [usage](/docs/limits) and [pricing](/pricing) limits for these functions apply to all cron job executions:
